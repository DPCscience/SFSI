## Penalized Family Index
In a Family Index the breeding value for each candidate of selection is estimated as a linear combination of the observed value of all the predictors (subjects in a training set). The contribution (regression coefficients) of all training subjects for each individual can be calculated simultaneously using the **BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Predictor)** that relies in kinship relationship (either pedigree- or marker-based) between candidates of selection and training data. 

In contrast to the kinship-based BLUP, the penalized Family Index (PFI) estimate the regression coefficients for each candidate with only a **subset** of the training subjects contributing to each individual's breeding value prediction. The higher the value of the penalization parameter the smaller the number of predictors contributing to the prediction. The kinship-based BLUP appears as the un-penalized case of the PFI. 

Predictive ability of both kinship-based BLUP and PFI will be compared using the 

### 1. Data
Data from CIMMYTâ€™s Global Wheat Program. Lines were evaluated for grain yield (each entry corresponds to an average of two plot records) at four different environments; phenotypes (*wheat.Y* object) were centered and standardized to a unit variance within environment. Each of the lines were genotyped for 1279 diversity array technology (DArT) markers. At each marker two homozygous genotypes were possible and these were coded as 0/1. Marker genotypes are given in the object *wheat.X*. Finally a matrix *wheat.A* provides the pedigree relationships between lines computed from the pedigree records. Data is available for download in the R-package 'BGLR'.
